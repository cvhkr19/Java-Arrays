In a town there are n people labelled from 1 to n. There is a rumour that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
If the town judge exists, then  : 
1) The town judge trusts nobody.
2) Everyone (except the town judge trusts the town judge. 
3) there is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2. 
You are given an array trust where trust[ai,bi] representing that the person labelled ai trusts the person labelled bi. Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise. 

Approaches :
1) Find missing number, check if it has n-1 votes. O(3n)
2) -1 for things on the left and +1 for stuff on the right O(2n).
